# Introduction
There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world…so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn’t only for banking activities, they also have the world’s most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

## Available Data

The Data Bank team have prepared a data model for this case study as well as a few example rows from the complete dataset below to get you familiar with their tables.

### Questions

#### A. Customer Nodes Exploration
1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?
2. What is the number of nodes per region?
3. How many customers are allocated to each region?
4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?

#### B. Customer Transactions
1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?
2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?
3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?
4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?
5. What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?
6. 
#### C. Data Allocation Challenge
To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month
Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days
Option 3: data is updated real-time

#### D. Extra Challenge
Data Bank wants to try another option which is a bit more difficult to implement - they want to calculate data growth using an interest calculation, just like in a traditional savings account you might have with a bank.

If the annual interest rate is set at 6% and the Data Bank team wants to reward its customers by increasing their data allocation based off the interest calculated on a daily basis at the end of each day, how much data would be required for this option on a monthly basis?

Special notes:

Data Bank wants an initial calculation which does not allow for compounding interest, however they may also be interested in a daily compounding interest calculation so you can try to perform this calculation if you have the stamina!
Extension Request.  The Data Bank team wants you to use the outputs generated from the above sections to create a quick Powerpoint presentation which will be used as marketing materials for both external investors who might want to buy Data Bank shares and new prospective customers who might want to bank with Data Bank.

Using the outputs generated from the customer node questions, generate a few headline insights which Data Bank might use to market it’s world-leading security features to potential investors and customers.

With the transaction analysis - prepare a 1 page presentation slide which contains all the relevant information about the various options for the data provisioning so the Data Bank management team can make an informed decision.
